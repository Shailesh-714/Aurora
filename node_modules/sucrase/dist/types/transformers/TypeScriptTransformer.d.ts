     * Detect name information about this enum key, which will be used to determine which code to emit
     * and whether we should declare a variable as part of this declaration.
     *
     * Some cases to keep in mind:
     * - Enum keys can be implicitly referenced later, e.g. `X = 1, Y = X`. In Sucrase, we implement
     *   this by declaring a variable `X` so that later expressions can use it.
     * - In addition to the usual identifier key syntax, enum keys are allowed to be string literals,
     *   e.g. `"hello world" = 3,`. Template literal syntax is NOT allowed.
     * - Even if the enum key is defined as a string literal, it may still be referenced by identifier
     *   later, e.g. `"X" = 1, Y = X`. That means that we need to detect whether or not a string
     *   literal is identifier-like and emit a variable if so, even if the declaration did not use an
     *   identifier.
     * - Reserved keywords like `break` are valid enum keys, but are not valid to be referenced later
     *   and would be a syntax error if we emitted a variable, so we need to skip the variable
     *   declaration in those cases.
     *
     * The variableName return value captures these nuances: if non-null, we can and must emit a
     * variable declaration, and if null, we can't and shouldn't.
